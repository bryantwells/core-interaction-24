You will be using Github to host your website online. Github provides free "Static HTML" hosting via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). At this point you should have a [Github](https://github.com/) account and the Github Desktop application.

## Create a New Github Repo
Open the Github Desktop App and click on the button that says `Add an Existing Repository from your Hard Drive...`. Choose your recently created folder â€“ you will see an alert that asks if you would like to create a repository in this directory. Click the blue text to confirm. Create your repo with the following settings:

> | Name | core-2-interaction |
  | Description | My Core 2: Interaction Website |
  | Local Path | /Users/[your-user-name]/Sites/core-2-interaction |

> ![](/files/lab/online-6.png)
> ![](/files/lab/online-1.png)

Finally, publish your repo to Github by clicking `Publish repository`, make sure to *uncheck* the 'keep this code private' checkbox:

Open your recently created Github repo in the browser by clicking the `View on GitHub` button, and navigate to your repo's "Pages" settings:

From this page, change your `Build and deployment` `Branch` to `main` and click `Save`:
