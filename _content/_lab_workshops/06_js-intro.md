So far we have focused on creating webpages using HTML and CSS (structure, style). With the introduction of Javascript, we can compute and perform actions within a webpage.


## The Console
We will use the dev console to monitor our javascript program. Utilizing the console is also very important in building and debugging your code.


## Types

At the root of any programming language, are types. The basic types are...

```
Number
String
Boolean
```

## Arithmetic

You may combine, manipulate values to create a desired output using arithmetic.

`+` to add two values  
`-` to sbtract  
`/` to divide  
`*` to multiply  
`%` to find the remainder after division of numbers


## Variables

To hold values, javascript uses varables. Variables may not contain spaces, and may not start with a number

~~~
var variableName = value;
~~~

~~~
var five = 5;
var two = 2;

conosle.log(two * five);
// ‚Üí 10
~~~

Often, you will want to keep track of a value that will change over time.

~~~
var myStudentDebt = 800;
myStudentDebt = myStudentDebt - 100;

console.log(myStudentDebt);
// ‚Üí 700
~~~

## Arrays

We may hold a list of values using an array. Array values are contained within two brackets (`[]`) and are separated by a comma (`,`).

~~~
var myLuckyNumbers = [ 4, 7, 9, 18 ];

console.log(myLuckyNumbers);
// ‚Üí [ 4, 7, 9, 18 ]
~~~

To access a value within an array, append the desired index number to the variable name;

~~~
console.log(myLuckyNumbers[1]);
// ‚Üí 7
~~~

You'll notice that even though we called the value with a No. "1" index, the array's the second value was returned. That's because array's are indexed starting at 0, not 1. This is an important concept to remember!

~~~
array    [ 4, 7, 9, 18 ]
index    --0--1--2--3---
~~~

## Functions

Functions allow us to break our code down into modules, and help make our code easier to use and read. Functions are defined with the following syntax:

~~~
var addFive = function(x) {
	return x + 5;
}
~~~

OR

~~~
function addFive(x) {
	return x + 5;
}
~~~

I prefer the second method. You may invoke a function like this:

~~~
addFive(5);
~~~

There are a few cardinal things to remember about functions:

1. Functions are not run immediately after they are defined, they must be invoked to return a value.
2. Functions may take multiple arguments
3. Variables declared within functions are not accessable outside of that function

## Comparisons

The result of a comparison will equal a boolean (true or false). Compare two values using the following special characters:

`<` "less than"  
`>` "greater than"  
`>=` "greater than or equal to"  
`<=` "less than or equal to"  
`==` "equal to"  
`!=` "not equal to"  

~~~
console.log(5 < 3);
// ‚Üí false

console.log(5 != 3);
// ‚Üí true

console.log(false == 0);
// ‚Üí true
~~~

## Conditional Statements

A conditional statement takes a condition, and executes a block of code only if the condition is true. For example:

~~~
var dollarsInPocket = 0;

if (dollarsInPocket > 2) {
    console.log('You can get a coffee.');
} else {
    console.log('You can have some water.');
}
~~~

## Loops

Loops allow us to run a chunk of code X amount of times, until a condition is filled. the syntax is as follows:

~~~
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
	code to be executed;
}
~~~

**Statement 1** is executed before the code on the inside of the loop is executed. This is where you define 'counter' variable.

**Statement 2** is the condition under which the code will run. When the this conditions is no longer true, the code inside the loop will no longer be executed.

**Statement 3** will run after each time the code within the loop is executed

~~~
var apples = 'üçé';
for (var i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(apples);
    apples += 'üçé';
}

\\ üçé
\\ üçé üçé
\\ üçé üçé üçé
\\ üçé üçé üçé üçé
\\ üçé üçé üçé üçé üçé
~~~

You may combine conditional statements with loops:  

~~~
console.log('\nHow many bites does it take to finsih an apple?');

for (var numberOfBites = 1; numberOfBites <= 6; numberOfBites++) {
    if (numberOfBites < 6) {
        console.log(`${ numberOfBites } Bite.`);
    } else {
        console.log('Done!')
    }
}
~~~
