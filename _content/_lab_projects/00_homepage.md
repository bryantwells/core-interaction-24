Your homepage will archive all of your course work and should link to you completed projects and exercises. You will maintain two copies of the site: one on your computer ('local') and one on GitHub ('remote'). Start with a plain HTML page and gradually improve on it as the semester progresses. Your homepage should...
- be clearly structured and navigable
- contain all of your projects and workshops from the quarter
- reflect your design sensibility
