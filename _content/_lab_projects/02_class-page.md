Copy the files from [this boilerplate](/files/lab/boilerplates/projects/02_class-page.zip) into your website's folder. Use the test pages within to help develop your own stylesheet for the shared class website. Your folder structure should look like this:

~~~
📂 core-2-interaction/
└─ 📂 lab/ 
   └─ 📁 projects/
      └─ 📁 02_class-page
         ├─ 📁 assets
         │  └─ 📄 style.css
         ├─ 📁 media
         │  └─ 📄 el-barto.png
         ├─ 📄 index.html
         ├─ 📄 calendar.html
         └─ 📄 post-list.html
~~~

As a reminder, the only file you should be modifying here is `style.css`!
