Design a website, using only HTML (get creative!), which introduces yourself to the class, and then links to one of your classmate's pages. Your website should include at least 11 pages with the following format:
- 1 welcome page, introducing yourself
- 9 fact pages, each including a single fact about yourself
- 1 handoff page, introducing your classmate and linking to their welcome page ([net-id].interactive.rodeo/lab/projects/01_introduction).
