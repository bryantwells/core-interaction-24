Design a website, using only HTML, which introduces yourself to the class, and then links to one of your classmate's pages. Your website should include at least 11 pages with the following format:
- 1 welcome page, introducing yourself
- 9 fact pages, each including a single fact about yourself
- 1 handoff page, introducing your classmate and linking to their welcome page (id.newschool.edu/lab/projects/01_introduction).
