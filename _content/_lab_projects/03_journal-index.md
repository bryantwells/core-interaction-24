Use [this boilerplate](/files/lab/boilerplates/projects/03_journal-index.zip) to create an 'index' for your observation journal entries. Your folder structure should look like this:

~~~
📂 core-2-interaction/
└─ 📂 lab/ 
   └─ 📁 projects/
      └─ 📁 03_journal-index
         ├─ 📄 index.html
         ├─ 📁 entries
         │  ├─ 📄 1.html
         │  ├─ ...
         │  └─ 📄 15.html
         ├─ 📁 assets
         └─ 📁 media
~~~

## Required Pages

Your site will include the following pages:

1. 1 index page, linking to each entry
2. 15 entry pages

## Required Information

Each entry should include the following information:

1. A Title
2. An Image (with alt text)
3. A Date
4. A piece of unique metadata (time of day, weather, feeling, etc.)


## Putting it Together

Your index page can include any subset of the required information, but your entry pages must include all 5 pieces of information. How can you use CSS positioning and layout properties to make a page with style and behaviour that is unique to your content? 

Remember to use semantic HTML! Make good use of the `<figure>` element.
